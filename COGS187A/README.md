HUERISTUC EVALUATION:
========================

////EVALUATION NOTES////////////

1. Visibility of system status
	The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. Probably the two most important things that users need to know at your site are:
		"Where am I?"
		"Where can I go next?"
	Make sure each page is branded and that you indicate which section it belongs to. Links to other pages should be clearly marked. Since users could be jumping to any part of your site from somewhere else, you need to include this status on every page.
	
- Nice idea (in theory) that takes a new perspective on...
- Home page design inconsistent with design of deeper hierarchy
- However, the consistancy remains with tab title and nav item title
- Color bar inconsistent with landing page's theme
- Hard to tell the navigation structure/hierarchy of website.
- The first nav tab, "Study with Us" has confusing links. Are these sub-pages, seperate from the website? separate part of the website??

2. Match Between System and the Real World
	The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

	On the Web, you have to be aware that users will probably be coming from diverse backgrounds, so figuring out their "language" can be a challenge.

- Overall, language seems alright.
- Landing page seems designed for people who have no idea about the university. Functions as a main overview of the University's
- System and real-world seems to match.

3.
- Logo link back to the homepage
- responsive design in place, good for accessibility through different device
- loads fairly consistently across multiple broswers
- background graphic on home page is not web-optimized

4. Consistency and Standardsaa
- Color scheme attempts to convey consistancy across nav tabs on home page. However, once you click a link, the background of the site appears to have a random color. To maintain consistancy, color should be the same as the link tab on the home page.
- Tab header text consistant
- consistant appearance across multiple browsers

5. Error prevention
- Forms are not validated in real-time. Must submit to see errors. Many forms now days will let you know if the text entered was not a valid email for the email field, etc.
- Red stars indicate required fields
- Some drop-down menus only have one option, in which case should not be drop-down. Perhpas check box o radio selection button would be more appropriate.

6.
- Any page deeper in the hierarchy from home page is "constructed" with consistancy, but does not at all read that way through the design.
- The navbar logo links to the homepage, as is standard for most websites. Therefore, it is redundant to have a link to the homepage in the nabar below the logo. Much of the "navbar" content on the site pages belongs in a footer.
