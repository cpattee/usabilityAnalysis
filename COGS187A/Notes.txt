////EVALUATION NOTES////////////

1. Visibility of system status
	
- Nice idea (in theory) that takes a new perspective on the navigation bar.
- Home page design inconsistent with design of deeper hierarchy
- However, the consistancy remains with tab title and nav item title
- Color bar inconsistent with landing page's theme
- Hard to tell the navigation structure/hierarchy of website.
- The first nav tab, "Study with Us" has confusing links. Are these sub-pages, seperate from the website? separate part of the website??

2. Match Between System and the Real World
	
- Overall, language seems alright.
- Landing page seems designed for people who have no idea about the university. Functions as a main overview of the University's
- System and real-world seems to match.

3.
- Logo link back to the homepage
- responsive design in place, good for accessibility through different device
- loads fairly consistently across multiple broswers
- background graphic on home page is not web-optimized

4. Consistency and Standards
- Color scheme attempts to convey consistancy across nav tabs on home page. However, once you click a link, the background of the site appears to have a random color. To maintain consistancy, color should be the same as the link tab on the home page.
- Tab header text consistant
- consistant appearance across multiple browsers, as well as on multiple devices.

5. Error prevention
- Forms are not validated in real-time. Must submit to see errors. Many forms now days will let you know if the text entered was not a valid email for the email field, etc.
- Red stars indicate required fields
- Some drop-down menus only have one option, in which case should not be drop-down. Perhpas check box o radio selection button would be more appropriate.

6.
- Any page deeper in the hierarchy from home page is "constructed" with consistancy, but does not at all read that way through the design.
- The navbar logo links to the homepage, as is standard 

7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
- search from home page links to Google search results within the University browser. From there, you can sort by date or relevance.
- searched directly on Google, a short summary of the University comes up, and it is bookmarked easily

8. Aesthetic and minimalistic design
- while there are progressive levels of detail to the site, the hierarchy is difficult to follow one page in from the home page.
- the homepage appears minimalistic, but does not function well as it is unclear which links are sub-categories, and where in the site you will be placed upon clicking.

9.
- Restricted Access pages have concise messages, and tell the user they must be logged in to view the content.
- A page that cannot be found does not display an error code, rather it explains in plain words that the page is not found.
- The page suggests other places within the site to look for the content that the user was trying to locate.
- It does not store the request as a search query and suggest specific pages, but does present different locations to look for information. 

10.
- Help site for everything from staff to students, prospective and current students
- There is a place to submit feedback to the sites' creators
- The University has a Social Media presence, which makes its content accessible and easy to find.
